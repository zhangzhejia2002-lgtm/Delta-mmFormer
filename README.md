# Delta-mmFormer
Delta-mmFormer is a multimodal Transformer developed for the CARE 2025 LiFS Challenge, addressing MRI classification with missing modalities. It extends mmFormer with a Delta-based compensation module that calibrates available modalities and generates attenuated proxy features, enabling robust liver fibrosis staging without external data.
